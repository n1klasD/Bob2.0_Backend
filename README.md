# Bob2.0_Backend
Backend for Personal Digital Assistant Bob 2.0

## Structure

The backend is structured with a microservice architecture. Currently, each folder *controller*, *entertainment*, *finances*, *journey* and *welcome* 
contains the code for one USECASE and docker container and therefore has an own dockerfile. The general structure is seen below.                                                                                    
     
Currently, each usecase consists of a flask application, which is a microframework for writing RESTful Apis in Python. The folder *src* contains the source code of the application. The *app.py* file is the entrypoint for the flask application. The files in the folder *tests* are evaluated using pytest. Their filename should start with *test_*. 

## Unittests and Continous Integration

When code is pushed into a USECASE folder, all unittests in the tests folder are automatically run using github actions. When all tests pass, the docker container 
is automatically built using the dockerfile and pushed to it´s respective docker hub repository. These repositories are public.
